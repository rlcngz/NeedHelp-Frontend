## Introduction:
This is an on/demand app which you can create your own space as a service provider or just a service user. As a service provider, you can promote your service and as a customer you can search for a service on map, you can get in touch with service provider and leave a comment. 

## Technology used:
### Backend
<ul>
  <li>Express</li>
  <li>REST</li>
  <li>Sequelize</li>
  <li>Postgres</li>
  <li>NodeJS</li>
  <li>Nodemailer</li>
</ul>

### Frontend
<ul>
  <li>React</li>
  <li>Redux</li>
  <li>Axios</li>
  <li>Bootstrap</li>
  <li>ReactLeaflet</li>
</ul>

## Goals of the project:
The main goal of this project is to gain experience developing a full-stack app. I also put a little extra emphasis on exploring new technologies and see how well and how fast I would be able to adapt to something new while also consolidating the knowledge of the technologies learned during the academy. For that purpose, I decided to use Nodemailer and ReactLeaflet as new technologies apart from the technologies I was already familiar with. I used a Bootstrap for the UI design which was also new to me. In short:

<ul>
  <li>Practice full-stack development,</li>
  <li>Learn new technologies,</li>
  <li>Implement a developer's approach by creating and following User stories and wireframes.</li>
</ul>

## User stories and Wireframe:

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/users/rlcngz/projects/1">User Stories</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://wireframepro.mockflow.com/view/MSWgUwOz4h">Wireframe</a></li>
</ul>

## Backend Repository:
The back-end was built in express and it is a REST a API. The database is built using Postgres and Sequelize. You can find the back-end's repository <a href="https://github.com/rlcngz/NeedHelp-Backend">here</a>
